Picture this: Full-time student taking full course load, working part time, leading a growing club at his college, actively working on half a dozen software projects and still finding time to run every other day. Seems like a handful, doesn't it? I'm often asked by many about how I manage my time, and I find myself repeating the answer. Hence this post.

This won't be a long post (trying not be ironic with this post), but I'll try to get my message across. If you find anything ambiguous or wrong, [get in touch](http://twitter.com/TheKaranGoel).

Set the alarm for an hour early - even on weekends. Find the right time
Don't feel guilty about lost time.
STFU and do it (stop reading, and start doing)
Make it fun (don't ask others how, figure a way that suits you)
exercising will help significantly
Ditch the TV and cable
Maintain a to-do list
Maintain a calendar
Write shit down
Things that take <5 minutes must be done ASAP
Inbox zero
Don't hang out with people who donâ€™t respect your time (say no)
Learn to cut to the chase
Time management == doing stuff AND finding time to hang out with humans
Automate everything
Prioritize (!)
Organize - room, homework, bag, mobile phone
Seek to optimize everything
ROI matters - 80/20. Spend time doing coursework that contributes most to learning and grades. Find your priorities.
Keep learning new skills - do not get rusty
Talk about what you are working on with the right people
