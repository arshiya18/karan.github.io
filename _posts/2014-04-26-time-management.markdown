Picture this: Full-time student taking full course load, working part time, leading [a growing club](https://www.facebook.com/groups/uwhackers/) at his university, actively working on [half a dozen software projects](https://github.com/karan) at any given time and still finding time to exercise every other day. Seems like a handful, doesn't it? That's my life in under 50 words. I'm often asked by many about how I manage my time, and I find myself repeating the answer. Hence this post.

This won't be a long post (trying not be ironic here), but I'll try to get my message across. Some of the early points will be what I do regularly and works for me. Some later ones will be common strategies and techniques to use to manage your time well, which I sometimes follow and they occasionally work for me.

### Set the alarm for an hour early - even on weekends

This is what I have recently started doing - I used to wake up at around 7 until a few months ago, but now I wake up at 6 in the morning. Yes, for college students, this is the "holy-shit-it's-too-early" time, but for me, it's the time when I am most productive. I have found that waking up early, washing up, and then working on personal projects gives me the most productive hour. The main point here however is to be consistent - sure if you pulled an all-nighter then you deserve to sleep, otherwise, keep your sleeping schedule consistent throughout the week (that includes weekends).

I highly recommend that you try this for yourself and find your perfect time.

### Don't feel guilty about lost time.

Seriously. Don't. You were partying till 3am last Friday and had a bad hangover the next day. It's done. Forget about it. Focus on today. That's what matters now.

### Set small goals, and stick to them

Until end of my freshman year, I just used to do whatever I wanted to. I did not really have a direction - I knew what I wanted, but didn't know how. Then I set micro-goals for myself:

- I'll write at least 1 Python script a day
- I'll talk to at least 1 new student every day
- I'll run at least 1 mile every other day

These small goals became my pathways. And trust me, these small goals have turned into huge life events. My coding skills have improved significantly, I'm able to learn new things really fast, I'm a much better listener and conversationist (still improving, though), and I recently ran a 5k. I'll say it again, being consistent with your goals rewards you greatly.

### Exercising will help significantly

I've been thinking of finding time to exercise since freshman year but just kept on avoiding it. Sometimes I was so busy that I used to spend almost 12 hours each day sitting in labs and working on homework. But now I forced myself to run every other day - no matter how, but I forced myself to take time out. What I have found is that physical activity can greatly improve your productivity by giving you a break from the usual. Go spend an hour at your gym at your school, you'll see what all there is, and maybe, like me, you'll run into an old friend you haven't seen for months.

### Automate everything

**Step 1:** Learn to code

**Step 2:** Automate repetitive tasks

**Step 3:** ???

**Step 4:** Profit

### Maintain a to-do list

I use [Wunderlist](https://www.wunderlist.com/en/) - and love it. Whenever I get something to do, I instantly add it to my list. I also maintain categories for easy management and classification of my todos. (Read next point)

### If something will take less than 2 minutes, do it now

The only exception to the previous rule is this - if I get something to do that will take me a minute or two, I complete it at the same moment. This keeps me from flooding my to-do list with micro-tasks, and don't give me a false sense of being busy (which humans inherently love.

### Prioritize (!)

One of the most crucial parts about having a to-do list is to know how to prioritize your tasks. Like most things in life, sadly there's no one-size-fits-all for your tasks. Know what you have to do now, or today, or this week, and what happens if you miss the deadline. Learn to think in a pro-cons way and to weight each side. Learn to take decisions for your life.

### Maintain a calendar

Kind of similar to maintaining a to-do list - any event, meeting, appointment, class goes into my calendar. I set appropriate notifications and reminders and make sure to see the calendar every morning to prepare myself for the day.

### Inbox zero

A few months ago, [I started doing this](http://klinger.io/post/71640845938/dont-drown-in-email-how-to-use-gmail-more) - highly recommended. At any given point, I have a total of 0 emails in my inbox. Whenever I can any new mail, I process it by either replying, or delegating, or archiving, or deleting.

### Don't hang out with people who donâ€™t respect your time

Ditch people who:

1. Force you to "have fun" when you don't want to
2. Don't value your work
3. Are always sad or otherwise negative

### Keep learning new skills

Now that you have a lot of free time, please don't spend it on playing video games or watching TV. Keep learning. Learn new things. Make sure you don't get rusty.

### Have fun

Life isn't just about finding ways to be more productive, or optimization of daily tasks. It's ok to take a break. Go for a walk once in a while. Go to a rave every couple months to vent out. Know when you are burned out and need to get away from everything and then actually do it.
