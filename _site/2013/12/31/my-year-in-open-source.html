        <h1 class="post-title">My year in open source and side projects!</h1>

        <section class="post-content">
            <p>Ok wow. What an year it has been. A lot happened with me in my personal life - both good and bad - but I&#39;ll try to refrain from speaking (or writing, technically) about them here.</p>

<p>This post is my reflection of my work in open source and side projects in 2013.</p>

<p><img src="http://karan.github.io/assets/images/year-1.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I joined <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> about 50 weeks ago, after reading a lot about it over on reddit. But the whole concept of version control made no sense to me at all. Like, what is &quot;<em>distributed</em> version control&quot;, &quot;who would use it&quot;, &quot;open source, ok cool&quot;. So, naturally, I didn&#39;t use it much.</p>

<p>Now here&#39;s the weird thing - a few days ago, I completed a <a href="https://github.com/karan">180-days streak</a> over on Github. Why? I have no idea. How? I kept on starting new projects, always working on stuff. Was it a good thing? Some will say no, I could have learned, say guitar, in that time. But if life is all about learning new things, and doing things you love, then I don&#39;t regret it a bit.</p>

<p>Now, by this point, you probably know that my writing sucks. I find it easier to create a timeline to get my message across. My timeline will be guided by the projects I worked on.</p>

<h3>A (solicited) list of my projects from 2013 in chronological order</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/karan/YALT">Yet Another Learning Tool</a> - helps you learn stuff</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/karan/MoodicPlayer">MoodicPlayer</a> - the weirdly-named mood-based playlist maker</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/karan/Projects">Projects</a> - literally, a <em>project</em></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/karan/RedditAgain">RedditAgain</a> - because no one will ever have just 1 reddit account</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/karan/TPB">TPB</a> - why is <em>this</em> data no open enough?</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/karan/HackerNewsAPI">HackerNews API</a> - a Python-API</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/karan/HNify">HNify</a> - a RESTful API</li>
</ul>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/karan/YALT">Yet Another Learning Tool</a></h3>

<p>Yet Another Learning Tool (YALT) is a lightweight and minimal utility to make it easier for you to remember things. It is a flash-card like system, where you&#39;lll be presented with random questions from selected database. With YALT, you have to spend less time learning more.</p>

<p><img src="http://karan.github.io/assets/images/year-2.png" alt=""></p>

<p>YALT, as I call it, was the first serious project I ever worked on. It was my first advent in the world of open source. It was the very first piece of code I put on Github. It was not a unique idea, and definitely not an open-source-worthy implementation. At the time, I was learning Java, and just wanted to make something cool with a minimal GUI. Because, buttons.</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/karan/MoodicPlayer">MoodicPlayer</a></h3>

<p>MoodicPlayer, using last.fm API, builds a playlist for users based on their mood.</p>

<p><img src="http://karan.github.io/assets/images/year-3.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The idea for this app(let) excites many people. As simple as the GUI looks, building the whole app, and getting things to work was painful. I locked myself in a room for 3 days just get the last.fm API auth (which was an alien concept to me) to work.</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/karan/Projects">Projects</a></h3>

<p><em>Projects</em> is a list of practical projects that anyone can solve in any programming language. These projects are divided in multiple categories.</p>

<p><img src="http://karan.github.io/assets/images/year-4.png" alt=""></p>

<p>This is when things started to get interesting for me. I wanted to learn Python. I did tons of tutorials online, but everyone just taught the basics. I had no idea what I was doing. I realized that I&#39;m not alone in this. There&#39;s other people who miss a better way to learn a language. Hence, this list. I announced it to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1huuqk/im_doing_100_projects_in_python_to_learn_the/">reddit</a> after which it just took off. As of today, the repo has 4000+ stars, and over <a href="https://github.com/karan/Projects-Solutions/graphs/contributors">40 people</a> have contributed their own solutions.</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/karan/RedditAgain">RedditAgain</a></h3>

<p>This little script helps migrate an old Reddit account to a new one.</p>

<p><img src="http://karan.github.io/assets/images/year-5.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Because I was learning Python at the time, and we all know how well the language works with the reddit API, I wanted to make something practically usable. Seeing how much throwaway accounts are used there, this was a great thing to make.</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/karan/TPB">TPB</a></h3>

<p>TPB is an unofficial Python API for ThePirateBay. (don&#39;t look at me like that.)</p>

<p><img src="http://karan.github.io/assets/images/year-6.png" alt=""></p>

<p>When I started this project, I was fascinated by the power of having open-everything. What access to data can do. One of the biggest (controversial) websites on the Internet, that runs exactly to take that motto forward, that no good API for developers. I said to myself, well, if no one wants to do it, I&#39;ll do it. The <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1lkg1y/thepiratebay_api_for_python/">response</a> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/1lkfyl/thepiratebay_api_for_python/">on reddit</a> is a clear indicator of what people want to do, but can&#39;t because of restrictions on data.</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/karan/HackerNewsAPI">HackerNews API</a> and <a href="https://github.com/karan/HNify">HNify</a></h3>

<p>HackerNews API is an unofficial Python API for HackerNews, and HNify is it&#39;s RESTful port.</p>

<p><img src="http://karan.github.io/assets/images/year-7.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I found it a little ironic that one of the top hacker sites had no open, working API. I took as a learning opportunity to change that. These projects were two of my biggest projects, with a diversity of new concepts and technologies that I had to learn. And <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6374031">people</a> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/flask/comments/1ph746/hnify_api_for_hacker_news_my_first_api_in_flask/">loved it</a>.</p>

<h3>A secret project</h3>

<p>Just last week, a friend and I started working on a new web app - a new way to discover and listen to music. It&#39;s still under development so I can&#39;t talk much about it. We&#39;re building it on the <a href="http://mean.io/">MEAN</a> stack, which I knew nothing about until a few days ago. I spent 3 days, in my room, writing code, reading up online about JS, node, express and pushed <a href="https://twitter.com/TheKaranGoel/status/417558558645813248">tons of code</a>. Even if this app isn&#39;t complete on time, I&#39;ll still be proud of learning a lagnuage in only a few days, enough to be able to make something usage (or maybe a prototype).</p>

<h3>Major takeaways</h3>

<p>All said and done, there&#39;s a few things that I particularly want to put out there. These are some of my major takeaways from this year:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Start projects</strong> - There&#39;s no bigger way of getting yourself motivated. Just get start.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Keep going until you hit a dead end</strong> - Try everything you can until you hit a dead end, at which point...</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ask for help</strong> - Trust me, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">SO</a> is a priceless resource.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Learn to prioritize</strong> - Now, I&#39;m a full-time international student, with a part-time job, so this really applies to me. But everyone should know to priorize their tasks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Do what you really want to do</strong> - Listen to what people say, see what they do, read about it, but do only what you want to. Doing anything that you are not self-motivated about is fruitless.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Surround yourself with people like you</strong> - <a href="http://blog.ivyexec.com/2013/you-are-the-average-of-5-people-you-surround-yourself-with/">You are the average of 5 people that surround you</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Don&#39;t be afraid to talk about your projects</strong> - It&#39;s not bragging if done right. If anything, there&#39;s a chance someone might be interested in what you&#39;re talking about and offer to help.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Don&#39;t just talk about your projects</strong> - That pisses people off.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Don&#39;t forget to take a break</strong> - As <a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/2013/05/06/how-to-be-a-workaholic-and-not-get-burnout/">Neil Patel</a> puts it: &quot;Just go crazy once a month, and you’ll find yourself to be a much more productive worker.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Numbers help, but don&#39;t matter</strong> - Internet points can help motivate you, but too much attention to them will make you lazy. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIDb6VBO9os">Here&#39;s a funny talk on that</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Always be learning</strong> - It&#39;s great that you know language x, try language y that has completely different paradigms. You know OOP, now try a functional language.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That&#39;s all for now folks. Here&#39;s to a prosperous 2014!</p>
